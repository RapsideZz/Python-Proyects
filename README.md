I´m feel so happy to upload my first project, im going to share a little part about what is the function or how its works.
I´ts easy, what the name says, Notes Manager, you need to create an account and then login in that, next, you can create and delete notes,
you can create and delete how much you want it, so, im going to talk about Which technologies i used for this project.
It should be emphasized about this project whas created by "Tech With Tim", i saw all the tutorial and created it, and then i added a little of new things like css.
Technologies:
1 - HTML (i used it for create the base of the project)
2 - Bootstrap (thats soo good for this project, used for the design of the proyect like navbars etc.)
3 - CSS (For the design xD)
4 - Python (For the backend of the project)
5 - SQAlchemy (For the creation of the database)
6 - Flask ( used for the creation of the "api")
